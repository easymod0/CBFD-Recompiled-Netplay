# Netplay tools

Work in progress for online multiplayer (issue #126, discussion #137). Lockstep netplay only works if
the same inputs always give the same game on every machine, so the first step is a determinism
harness: record a game's inputs, replay them, and compare a hash of the game's memory read by read.

## The harness

Built only with the CMake option `CONKER_NETPLAY` (off by default). With the build scripts, on a
clean build folder (they keep what it was configured with):

    CONKER_CMAKE_ARGS=-DCONKER_NETPLAY=ON ./build.sh             (Linux, macOS)
    set CONKER_CMAKE_ARGS=-DCONKER_NETPLAY=ON && build.cmd       (Windows)

or by hand, `cmake -S host -B host/build -DCONKER_NETPLAY=ON`. Netplay also needs protobuf and, but on
Windows, OpenSSL (for GameNetworkingSockets):

- **Linux:** `libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libssl-dev` (on Ubuntu); `build.sh` checks for them.
- **macOS:** `brew install protobuf openssl@3`; `build.sh` checks for them and points CMake at OpenSSL.
- **Windows:** nothing to install: protobuf comes from the vcpkg that Visual Studio 2022 (17.6 and later)
  installs with its C++ workload (or `VCPKG_ROOT`'s), as `host/src/netplay/net/vcpkg.json` asks, built
  static so the game needs no more DLLs. The first build takes about 20 minutes longer; vcpkg keeps it,
  so later ones don't.

Its options (see `host/src/netplay/harness.cpp`):

| Option | |
|---|---|
| `--record <file>` | records the pads the game reads, at each controller read |
| `--replay <file>` | gives the game the recorded pads instead (starts the game directly), and quits after the last read |
| `--hash-log <file>` | logs the XXH3-64 of the game's memory at each controller read |
| `--dump-at <n>` | writes the game's memory at read `n` to `<hash-log>.<n>.bin` (can be repeated) |
| `--ignore <addr>:<size>` | leaves a known difference out of the hash (hex, e.g. `800BE6F0:8`; can be repeated) |
| `--stop-after <n>` | quits after read `n` |
| `--ports <n>` | the game sees controllers on ports 1 to `n`, without paks (a replay uses its recording's) |
| `--fast` | runs the timeline as fast as the host can, without waiting for real time (headless) |
| `--jitter <us>` | sleeps at random, up to `us` microseconds, at the game's OS calls and in the graphics thread: a test that the host's speed doesn't change the game |
| `--state-test <s>:<l>` | takes a save state after read `s` and loads it at read `l`, so the game goes back and on again: the hash log then holds the reads after the load, which should match a run without it |
| `--real-time` | runs the game on the time, as normally, instead of the timeline, to compare |

While any of these are used, the game starts from an empty save of its own (`saves/harness/`, emptied
each run; your own save isn't touched) and sees fixed controllers. Reads are counted from the first,
so read `n` of one run is read `n` of another, and the pads are recorded as the N64 reads them (after
the sticks are converted), which is what netplay will send. The runtime's own host pointers in game
memory (each thread's context in its `OSThread`) are always left out of the hash.

While the harness is used, the game runs on the runtime's virtual timeline (deterministic mode,
`ultramodern/timeline.hpp`, in `recomp/n64modernruntime.patch`): game code takes no virtual time, and its VIs (exactly 60 a second), timers and task
completions are delivered only when the game is idle, so the same inputs give the same game however
fast the host is. Its clock (`osGetCount`, `osGetTime`) is the timeline's, plus about a microsecond
each time it's read. A headless replay with `--fast` takes about 1.8 s for 2,700 reads (90 s of game).
`--real-time` turns it off: then two replays differ at the deadlines of two timers the game sets from
the clock (`--ignore 8003A598:8 --ignore 800BE6F0:8`), and at the order events arrive in.

The sound plays on the timeline too (`host/src/audio_clock.cpp`). The game's audio thread sizes
each buffer by how much is left of the one playing (`osAiGetLength`), and the MP3 player that cutscenes
and lip-sync wait on is paced by it. Normally that comes from the sound device's queue, whose pace
differs from run to run, and headless has none. While the harness is used, each buffer the game hands
over (`osAiSetNextBuffer`) instead ends at a fixed time on the timeline after the one before, as the
N64's audio interface plays them, and the length is what's left of the buffer playing at the
timeline's time, headless and in a window alike. The sound device only plays what it's given: it
waits for about 70 ms of sound before it starts (and again if it runs dry), and drops buffers while it's
over about 270 ms behind. A save state holds the buffers still playing.

A window replay now matches a headless one. Of the session recorded on 2026-10-14, the first 12,000
reads (6.7 minutes: the opening cutscenes and the first chapter) give the same hashes in a window
and headless; in the window the device ran dry once, before the first buffer started, and dropped
nothing. Before the sound went on the timeline, two windows split from each other at about read 360,
and while the renderer still wrote into game memory a window split from headless at read 2.

Runs from the same build share the data folder (the stored ROM, which `--rom` writes, and
`saves/harness/`), so two at once break each other: give each its own with `--data <folder>` (made if
need be; pass `--rom` too the first time). Two `--fast` replays run at once that way give the same
hashes as one run alone.

### The netplay settings profile

While the harness is used, the settings that change the game or what's in its memory are fixed
(`host/src/netplay/profile.cpp`), whatever the menus say, so a recording made in a window replays the
same headless or on another machine:

- **Each player's own:** the mouse and gyro (R-Look, the aiming modes, the orbit camera) and the
  settings that change what they and the stick do there: each response (Smooth or Direct), each
  invert, and Mouse: Turn the Camera (`host/src/netplay/motion.cpp`); and Camera: Field of View, which
  widens or narrows that player's camera (`host/src/field_of_view.cpp`: it changes the game's culls and
  aiming, so every machine applies every player's own). A player's movement is part of
  their input for each controller read, like their pad: every poll's movement (with their sensitivity)
  is added up and taken at the read on the game thread, in fixed point, so every machine gives the game
  the same, and each player's camera takes their own (in a match, every player's camera turns by its
  player's mouse). Their settings (their *Controls*) go with it, every read: one changed in a match
  takes effect at the same read on every machine. The camera code then uses `same_math.hpp`'s trigonometry, as the C libraries'
  differ in the last bit.
- **Off:** Right Stick: Free Camera, Aiming: Swap Sticks and the mouse in the bank's leaps: single
  player's, and the first two go by the time between frames.
- **At their defaults:** the Camera tab's others (Invert Turning, Turning Speed, Lock-On), Conker's Detail, Cutscene Aspect Ratio (Expand) and the sound volumes (100%).
- **Widescreen:** the culls and sprites are widened for 16:9 whatever the window (a wider window can
  lose a little at its sides).
- **Save states** (F5, F7) are off. **Mods:** none, in netplay matches, recordings and replays: a mod
  is native code the other players would have to trust, and a recording doesn't say which were on.
  Netplay won't host or join with one on, and the handshake still carries a hash of each mod's file
  and saved settings, so the host refuses a player with any ("mods on"). Texture packs only change
  the picture: they're left out, and can differ.
- **The renderer** writes nothing into game memory. RT64's Render to RAM copies each frame's
  colour and depth images back into the game's memory, as the N64's RDP did, from the graphics thread
  whenever it gets to the display list. Headless, with no renderer, nothing is written. So a window
  run differed from a headless one from read 2 (the depth image at `0x800E9D80`), and the copies raced
  the game. RT64 still draws everything on the GPU; only the copy back is off
  (`RT64::setRenderToRAMOff`, `rt64.patch`), so what the game's own code reads back from those images
  is whatever was there before (as headless).

What only changes the picture or the sound outside game memory (the renderer's settings, Overscan
Borders, Show FPS, the reticle, texture packs) and what only changes the pads or the movement (the
controls, the sensitivities) is left to the player: those are what's recorded, and what netplay sends.

### Recordings

A recording (version 3) holds the ROM's XXH3-64 and the profile's hash: a replay with another ROM or
another profile is refused before the game starts. `make_inputs.py` writes 0 for both, which isn't
checked. It holds each player's mouse and gyro movement and Controls beside their pad at each read.
Version 2 recordings (before the mouse) replay with no movement and the default settings;
version 1 recordings (before the profile) are replayed unchecked.

### The determinism check

After a change, run `tools/netplay/check.sh` (with the game built with `CONKER_NETPLAY=ON`). It makes a
recording of 2,700 made-up reads (`make_inputs.py --seed 1`), replays it headless four ways (twice, with
random sleeps in the host, and through a save state taken and loaded on the way) and compares each
hash log with the first. Each run is stopped once its last read is logged. `--mouse` gives the made-up
recording mouse and gyro movement and settings of its own; `--recording <file>` checks another
recording instead, e.g. a match where everyone moves their mouse and aims (`make_match.py --mouse`). The CI runs it on pushes
that touch what decides determinism (`.github/workflows/netplay.yml`), where the ROM secrets are set,
as for the other builds.

A typical comparison, of two replays of the same recording:

    host/build/ConkerRecomp --headless --replay run.pads --hash-log a.log
    host/build/ConkerRecomp --headless --replay run.pads --hash-log b.log
    tools/netplay/compare_hashes.py a.log b.log

and, at the read where they first differ, the memory itself:

    ... --hash-log a.log --dump-at 900    (and the same for b)
    tools/netplay/compare_hashes.py a.log b.log --dumps a.log.900.bin b.log.900.bin

## The transport

`host/src/netplay/net/` holds what goes over the network, and builds without the game or the ROM
(its `CMakeLists.txt`). The game links it with `CONKER_NETPLAY`, for the lockstep (below).

- **GameNetworkingSockets** (v1.6.1, downloaded while configuring): encrypted UDP connections, direct by
  address. The host listens on a port; the others connect to it, and it passes their inputs on. Its
  NAT traversal and relays (ICE) are off for now, so the host may have to forward the port.
- **`packets.cpp`**: every packet (Hello, Welcome, Refuse, Start, Inputs, Hash, Bye), fixed-size and
  versioned, each field checked; the only code that reads from the network. `packets_test.cpp` tests
  it and `fuzz_packets.cpp` fuzzes it.
- **`session.cpp`**: the host makes a random 64-bit key for each match (from the system's random
  source), which is in the join code. A joiner's Hello must carry it: a wrong key is closed at once and
  told nothing else, so a stranger who finds the port can't take a place, or learn whether their build
  or ROM would have done. With the right key, the handshake refuses another build, ROM, settings
  profile or mods, a full or started match. A joiner has 3 s to say Hello, and the host takes at most 8
  connections at once. Then each peer sends only its own port's pads and memory hashes, reliably (lost
  packets are resent: lockstep needs every input); Inputs and hashes before the start, beyond the reads
  a peer could have reached, or a hash repeated, drop the peer. The library closes a connection that
  sends a message bigger than the largest packet, and buffers little from each peer.
- **`join_code.cpp`**: the host's address, port and the match's key as a code with a typo check
  (`SC07-21V9-GW0J-6HB7-H6NW-VVTT`); joining needs it.
- **What players should know:** the join code is the host's IP address and port, so it's for people the
  host trusts, and joining shows the host the joiner's IP address (the menu says so). The connections
  are encrypted, but not authenticated: there's no certificate authority, so someone on the network path
  between two players could pose as the host. Joining by a code from someone you know keeps that to
  people who can already see your traffic.
- **`netplay_probe`**: two or more copies play a made-up match (`host <port>`, which prints its join
  code for 127.0.0.1, `join <code>`, `--loss <percent>`) and check every pad arrived right; `--hostile`
  joiners must be dropped, `join --silent` checks a joiner that never says Hello is dropped and `join
  --oversize` one that sends too big a message; `code <address:port> <key>` prints a code. `test.sh` runs
  the tests and a few matches; `.github/workflows/netplay-transport.yml` runs them on Windows, Linux and
  macOS (no ROM needed).

## Lockstep

`host/src/netplay/lockstep.cpp`, part of the harness: every peer runs the whole game, and at each
controller read the game waits until it has every player's pad (and mouse and gyro movement) for that
read. A peer sends its own `--input-delay` reads ahead to hide the time it takes to arrive: the host
chooses it for everyone and sends it with Start. By default it's `auto`: from the round trips to the
players as the match starts, enough reads to cover the slowest way an input goes (half of each of the
two slowest round trips, as the host passes joiners' inputs on), less the few ms a read can wait without
the game falling behind. On a local network that's 0, so the others' input reaches the game as soon as
this player's own, which matters for the mouse. Every
30 reads the peers compare hashes of the game's memory, and a difference ends the match as a desync.
Each peer starts from boot with an empty save, on the timeline and with the settings profile.

    ConkerRecomp --netplay-host 27015 --netplay-address 203.0.113.7 --players 2   (prints the join code)
    ConkerRecomp --netplay-join SC07-21V9-GW0J-6HB7-H6NW-VVTT                    (the host's code)

The game waits at its start for every player. Each plays with their first controller, and the host
has to forward its UDP port if it's behind a router.

In a window, the launcher's **Netplay** menu (`host/src/netplay/menu.cpp`, #9) does the same: host
(players, port, input delay, and the host's own address, from which it shows the join code to send once hosting) or
join by code. It says how the connecting goes and why a peer was refused, and the game starts on every
machine once all are in. When a match started there ends (a desync, a player gone), a prompt says why
instead of the game quitting.

**Screens.** Every machine draws the whole split screen (that keeps the games the same), but a window can
show only its player's view, drawn across the whole window ("my view only", `host/src/netplay/view.cpp`).
The host sets the match's rule: by default everyone sees only their own view, so no one can look at the
others' (the Netplay menu's Screens, or `--split-screen` to let each player choose with their menu's Your
screen or `--my-view-only`). The rule reaches every peer with Start. It can't be enforced against a
modified build, which could still show every view: it keeps honest players on the same footing.

With `--replay`, a peer's own pads come from its port in the recording instead: `lockstep.sh` plays two
copies against each other on this machine (`--data` gives each its own folder) and checks that each
gets exactly the game a replay alone does (each copy's recording has the other's port scrambled, so it
only does if the pads came over the network), with input delay 0 and `--jitter` on one side too; a
3-player Deathmatch where everyone moves their mouse and aims, at the automatic delay (through the
host's relay); and that a desync (`--netplay-desync-at <read>`) is caught. About 40 s.

## The scripts

| Script | |
|---|---|
| `check.sh` | the determinism check: replays a made-up recording headless twice, with `--jitter` and with `--state-test`, and fails unless all four give the same hashes (about 30 s; the CI runs it, `.github/workflows/netplay.yml`) |
| `lockstep.sh` | the lockstep check: copies in a match over loopback give the same game as a replay alone (2 players, and 3 with the mouse), and a desync is caught (about 40 s) |
| `compare_hashes.py` | the first read two hash logs differ at (it exits 1 if they differ); with dumps, the ranges that differ, by data symbol |
| `make_match.py` | a recording that plays from boot into a multiplayer match (`--mode`, `--players`, `--variant`, `--pause`; `--mouse` has everyone move, aim and use their mouse and gyro), the same every time: for looking at multiplayer (split screen, "my view only") without the menus |
| `shot.sh` | replays a recording in a window as fast as it goes and saves a screenshot of its end (X11; `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=x11` under Wayland), e.g. `make_match.py heist.pads --mode heist && shot.sh heist.pads heist.png --my-view-only` |
| `xwin.py` | drives a game window from a script: screenshots, clicks, keys (X11, python-xlib) |
| `make_inputs.py` | a recording of made-up inputs from a seed, to replay without anyone playing |
| `scan_clock.py` | every read of the game's clock in its code, and whether it's in a loop (needs your ROM, unpacked with `recomp/unpack_rom.py`) |
| `dis_around.py` | the instructions around a function's clock reads |
