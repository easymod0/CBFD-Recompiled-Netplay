# The lockstep check (netplay): two copies of the game on this machine play a match over
# loopback, each giving its own port's pads from the same made-up 2-port recording, and must give the
# game exactly what a replay of that recording alone does, read by read. Run it after building with
# CONKER_NETPLAY=ON:
#
#   tools/netplay/lockstep.sh [--exe host/build/ConkerRecomp] [--rom conker/baserom.us.z64]
#                             [--reads 1800] [--seed 2] [--timeout 300] [--out <folder>]
#
# The runs, all headless and --fast, each copy with a data folder of its own (--data):
#   solo       the recording replayed alone
#   match      host and joiner, input delay 2: both hash logs must match solo's. Each is given a copy
#              of the recording with the other's port scrambled, so it only gets the right game if the
#              other's pads come over the network
#   mouse      a 3-player Deathmatch where everyone moves their mouse, gyro and scroll wheel and aims
#              (make_match.py --mouse), alone and as a match of three at the automatic input delay, each
#              copy with the others' pads and movement scrambled: all three must match the solo replay
#   jittery    the same with input delay 0 and random sleeps (--jitter 500) on the joiner, so the two
#              are out of step and wait for each other all the time
#   desync     the host changes a byte of its memory at read 300: both must stop for a desync
# It exits 0 if all is as it should be, 1 if not. The logs are kept in --out (a temporary folder
# otherwise). As in check.sh, a run is judged by what it prints and then stopped. It uses UDP ports 27310 to 27313 on 127.0.0.1.
