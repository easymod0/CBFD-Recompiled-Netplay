// Netplay's lockstep: every peer runs the whole game, and at each controller read gives
// it every player's pad for that read, so the same inputs give each the same game. A peer's own pad is
// sent a few reads ahead (the input delay) to hide the time it takes to arrive; the game waits at a read
// until every pad for it is there. Every so often the peers compare hashes of the game's memory, and a
// difference ends the match (a desync).
//
// Part of the harness (harness.cpp), which gives it the deterministic timeline, the settings profile
// and an empty save on each peer. For now it's started from the command line (the menu is #9):
//
//   --netplay-host <port>        hosts a match on UDP <port> (port 1 of the game is the host's)
//   --players <n>                ...of <n> players, 2 to 4 (2 by default)
//   --split-screen               (hosting) let each player choose what they see; by default every player
//                                sees only their own view of the split screen (the match's rule, for all)
//   --netplay-address <address>  (hosting) this computer's address as the others reach it: the join code
//                                is made from it and printed (it holds the match's random key)
//   --netplay-join <code>        joins the host by its join code
//   --input-delay <reads|auto>   (hosting) how many reads ahead each peer's own pads are sent, 0 to 8, or
//                                auto (the default): chosen from the round trips to the players as the
//                                match starts. The host tells everyone (Start)
//   --netplay-desync-at <read>   (a test) changes a byte of game memory at that read, which the next
//                                hash comparison must catch
//
// The game waits at its start for every player to join. With --replay, each peer's own pads come from
// its port in the recording instead of its controller: peers replaying the same recording give the
// game exactly what a replay alone would (tools/netplay/lockstep.sh tests that).
