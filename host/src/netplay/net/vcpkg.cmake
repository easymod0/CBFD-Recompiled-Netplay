# Netplay on Windows: protobuf (for GameNetworkingSockets) comes from vcpkg, as the manifest beside
# this file says, built static (x64-windows-static-md) so the game needs no more DLLs. Included before
# project() (host/CMakeLists.txt with CONKER_NETPLAY, and this folder's CMakeLists.txt).
#
# The vcpkg is VCPKG_ROOT's, which Visual Studio 2022 (17.6 and later) sets in its developer
# environment for the vcpkg it installs with the C++ workload, or else Visual Studio's own. The first
# build takes about 20 minutes (protobuf and abseil); vcpkg then keeps them in its own cache, so later
# builds, even from a clean folder, take seconds. A toolchain file given on the command line is left
# alone. Linux and macOS use their system's protobuf instead.
